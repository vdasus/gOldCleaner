# How to contribute

## Pull requests

I welcome pull requests. Please include a clear description of the changes you have made with your request.

Please be patient as it may take a while for me to get back to you. If you have any specific expectations of when a pull request needs to be merged then please make this clear in your description.

Changes such as bug fixes and enhancements are easy to accept, while breaking changes may require a little more consideration. The more breaking change is involved in a pull request, the longer it will take to consider and the more likely it is to be rejected.

If you have an idea for some more involved enhancements then I'd recommend getting in touch with me first by opening an issue.

## Technical expectations

The first thing I'll do is check that all the unit tests run. 

I would also prefer it if any new features are covered by unit tests.

In terms of code conventions this should read as pretty vanilla C# code. The key thing here is to make it readable and clear. I generally prefer to fully comment any public methods or properties.
